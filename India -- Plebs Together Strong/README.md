## 📖 About Us
Plebs Together Strong is a small Bitcoin initiative in the coastal state of Goa. We're actually just a group of friends who just dived into the the Bitcoin education scene as our little way of making a positive impact in our local community. 
We host regular monthly meetups and Q&A sessions for those that are curious to know more about Bitcoin and also for other Bitcoiners to find each other and discuss ideas. 
Our aim is to demystify Bitcoin for the locals, helping them understand how the technology can be used to safeguard their futures and thus be able to engage in more meaningful pursuits with their time. 
Our mission is to bring Bitcoin to the masses across India. We intend to do so by creating a replicable hyper-local Bitcoin-only community blueprint, and have a presence in every major city and town in the country.
